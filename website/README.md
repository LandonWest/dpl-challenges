# Website Challenge

## Running
	
	open `index.html` in your browser

## Concept

	I own a really unique business. My website is a basic website that allows people to see what I do, and contact me about my services.
	
## Issues
	
	I tried to use nano to update my website, but it broke. Nothing shows right.
	
## Goal

1. Fix the website so all pages link together, and all images display correctly. Screen shots have been provided as what the original site looked like.
2. Validate markup using http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
3. Fix stylesheets.

## Bonus

	If completed early, add a rotating banner displaying all my awesome work. Add some more images you find online.
