# Rails Challenge

## Running

it doesn't...

## Concept

This is a real rails application built in 2010 for an actual client. No code has been tampered with.
This client used this rails app as a CMS to handle his gym's website. The app has not been updated in 4 years.
4 years in the tech world is like a decade. So many things have changed since then.

As a developer you'll be given tasks to do on old software. Even tasks to upgrade old software.

## Issues
The only is is that the app is really old. It runs on rails 2.3

## Goal
Get this app running, and fully operational and seeded. The admin section should be accessible, and the whole app should work fine.


## Bonus

Upgrade the app to rails 4 ;)
